    	<p><h1>A Fish Called Selma</h1> <p>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</p> <h2>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h2> <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Duffman can't breathe! OH NO!</p> <ul> <li>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</li> <li>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</li> <li>And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.</li> </ul> <h3>A Streetcar Named Marge</h3> <p>Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip; Here's to alcohol, the cause of &mdash; and solution to &mdash; all life's problems. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</p> <h4>The Last Temptation of Homer</h4> <p>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.</p> <ol> <li>I stand by my racial slur.</li> <li>Here's to alcohol, the cause of &mdash; and solution to &mdash; all life's problems.</li> <li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</li> </ol> <h5>Bart the Daredevil</h5> <p>Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Human contact: the final frontier. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow&hellip;and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>
